\section{Introduction \label{sec:introduction}}

Average global surface temperature is rising at an increasing rate --- approximately $0.09\degree$~C per decade since 1880, and approximately $0.26\degree$~C per decade since 1979 \cite[][]{ipcc2013_atmosphere}
--- and has contributed to significant melting of the
Greenland ice sheet, with recent ice loss approximated at $-244$~Gt per
year \cite[][]{Harig+2015a,Harig+2016}. The Greenland Ice Sheet covers just over 1\% of
Earth's surface, and, if completely melted, would raise sea level by over $7$~m
\cite[][]{ipcc2013_cryosphere}.
Massive loss of ice has
significant repercussions for human civilization, bringing with it a rising sea
level at about $1$--$2$~mm per year at the end of 2010
\cite[][]{ipcc2013_sealevel}.  Our broad goal is to understand deviations from modeled rates of Greenland ice melt in order to better understand, predict, and
communicate the changing conditions of the planet.

Shown in \textbf{A} are the $\underline{m}_1$ (linear) and $\underline{m}_2$ (quadratic) models for 01/2003--06/2013, comparable to previous estimates of the mass trend \citep{Harig+2016}. Note the significant departure of the extrapolated $\underline{m}_2$ model from the continuing signal. Shown in \textbf{B} is the $\underline{m}_1$ linear model for 01/2003--06/2017 with the standard of deviation of its residuals. Note that the $\underline{m}_1$ model does not significantly change after including the entire GRACE record. Error bars represent $2\sigma$ based on the combined variance of modeled Slepian coefficients $f_{\alpha}$ (see \cite{Harig+2016}, as well as \cite{getraerFall,getraerSpring}). This figure appeared in \cite{getraerFall,getraerSpring}, here with minor updates.} \label{fig:Getraer}
\end{figure}

Ice loss on the Greenland Ice Sheet has been observed in
gravitational measurements from NASA's Gravity
Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), satellite and airplane based
altimetry, and energy balance models, finding acceleration of melt in the ice mass signal over most of the last two decades \cite[][]{khan2015,Harig+2016}. Rates of ice loss increase by a
combination of greater discharge from calving glacier termini at the edges of
the ice-sheet and decreased surface mass-balance, the difference between
seasonal snow accumulation and melting \cite[][]{khan2015,enderlin2014}.
Significant inter-annual variability and asynchronicity has been observed in
the discharge rates of the Greenland Ice Sheet's major drainage basins, while
surface mass-balance is comparatively more predictable
\cite[][]{mcmillan2016,enderlin2014}. Both contributions to ice loss accelerated between 2000--2012, combining for a total acceleration of ice mass
estimated around $-30$~Gt per year$^2$ over all of Greenland
\cite[][]{velicogna2009,enderlin2014}.

\caption[Atmospheric Circulation Around Greenland]{Example of atmospheric conditions at the $250$~hPa isobar over the North Atlantic preceding record Greenland Ice Sheet surface melt, 07/09/2012 (from MERRA-2 reanalyzed data). Isobar height contours are labeled in $10^4$~m, and wind vectors are shown by arrows. Note the location of the northern polar jet stream, dividing the low and high isobar heights around the $1.05\times 10^{4}$~m contour. The temporary North Atlantic Rossby wave is labeled as the ``HI'' pressure anti-cyclone moving north towards southern Greenland, with a complementary ``LO'' pressure cyclone centered over Labrador. Note that the jet stream is deflected through the Labrador Sea and Baffin Bay, along the West Coast of Greenland. As a result of these conditions, the ``LO'' pressure over Reykjav\'ik is pushed north, and the pressure difference between Reykjav\'ik  and Azores is lowered, resulting in an negative NAO index (top left).} \label{fig:jetstream}
\end{figure}

A study by \cite{Harig+2016} modeling the mass of the Greenland Ice Sheet
using GRACE data products showed deviations from the long-term accelerating
trend, starting with a high level of melt in the summer of 2012, and followed by two
summers of little melting in 2013 and 2014 \cite[see
Figure~\ref{fig:Getraer} A, comparable to][their
Figure~4]{Harig+2016}. Our analysis of the complete GRACE data set (2002--2017) using identical methods showed a linear,
not accelerating, trend of ice loss for the Greenland Ice Sheet, constraining the observed unexpected deviations to an unusually large melt summer of 2012 followed by a summer of unusually little melt in 2013 (see
Figure~\ref{fig:Getraer} B). 


The anomalous seasons of 2012--2013 have received attention in recent literature by studies attempting to understand how surface mass balance processes produce such inter-annual variability. Correlations have been found with climate indices such as the phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) \cite[][]{mcmillan2016,bevis2018,getraerFall}, transient atmospheric transport of warm air and water vapor in so-called "atmospheric rivers" \citep{mattingly2018}, and non-radiative energy flux enhanced by short-term cloud cover \citep{solomon2017}.

\caption[The Discrete Grid Around Greenland]{A grid is defined in the global basis on a face of the Cubed Sphere centered on Greenland, upon which the gravitational anomaly is evaluated from the GRACE spherical harmonic solutions. In the image basis the grid is cartesian with length $256$. Grid lines in the image basis represent the diminishing spatial support of wavelets of different levels, from $\zeta=8$ (the entire image) to $\zeta=1$ (a unit grid cell). Note that in reality, each wavelet level has coverage over the entire image. The dotted line around Greenland is a coastal buffer of $0.5^{\circ}$ as in \cite{Harig+2016}. This Figure appeared in my Spring JP.} \label{fig:thegrid}

The atmospheric circulation affecting the Greenland Ice Sheet is broadly controlled by the position of the polar jet stream in the northern hemisphere \cite[][]{hanna2013,mattingly2018}. Specifically, strong summer melt events often occur with a negative NAO index and high pressure ``blocking'' over southern Greenland, advecting warm moist air into the Arctic along the west coast of Greenland \cite[][]{hanna2013,mattingly2018,mcmillan2016,bevis2018,getraerFall}. The NAO index broadly represents the difference in atmospheric pressure between the typically cold, low-pressure Arctic air near Reykjav\'ik, Iceland, and the typically warm, high-pressure air near Azores, Portugal, divided by the location of the polar jet stream (see Figure~\ref{fig:jetstream}). When the Azores high-pressure system pushes the jet stream northward, the pressure difference across the North Atlantic is weaker, producing a negative NAO index (Figure~\ref{fig:jetstream}). This temporary high-pressure excursion into the arctic is known as a Rossby wave and is accompanied by complementary low-pressure cyclones which develop on either side of the high-pressure block, the combined flow from which advects warm air into the Arctic until the Rossby wave ``breaks'' and the jet stream return to its typical location. These atmospheric conditions are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:jetstream}, illustrating the Greenland blocking event in July 2012, immediately preceding record surface melting on the Greenland Ice Sheet on 07/11/2012 \cite[][]{hanna2013,mattingly2018}.





The general conclusions drawn by these studies point to common atmospheric processes of uncommon duration or intensity.

By adding in the real values of only four wavelet coefficients back into the modeled wavelet reconstruction we improve the variance explanation by $15\%$. These wavelets are shown inset, weighted by their values in September 2012, the extreme of the deviation, and are concentrated in southwestern Greenland. ``m$_{\zeta\gamma}$'' refers to a wavelet basis function ``m'' of index $\gamma$ in level $\zeta$. This Figure appeared in my Spring JP.
\label{fig:deviant}}
\end{wrapfigure}

In my Spring 2018 JP, I explored the use of a 2-D wavelet basis to represent the GRACE gravimetric data over Greenland such that meaningfully contributing basis functions also contained information about spatial structure (see
Figure~\ref{fig:thegrid}). 

I developed a procedure for choosing the most important wavelet basis functions in order to extract the true fluctuation of the signal from the over-determined image calculated from the typical GRACE spherical harmonic basis. I then tested which wavelet basis function best captured the 2012--2013 deviation from the expected signal, finding the deviations to be concentrated in southwestern Greenland (see
Figure~\ref{fig:deviant}). 



\section{Data}

Observations of ice loss are measured remotely by weighing the mass by gravitational anomaly, photographing the surface area, and by measuring relative height of the ice with passive and active altimetry.

In addition to data sets which directly measure aspects of ice change, we have complimentary measurements which capture some of the processes which control melting, such as air temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. Atmospheric data are measured directly at weather station all over the world, and are synthesized into large continuous data sets referred to as "reanalysis" data. "Reanalysis" data sets are the outputs of climate models, which use assumptions about the laws which govern atmospheric processes to compute simulations of the atmosphere constrained by directly observed weather data.



\section{Next steps}

\begin{enumerate}
\item quantitative image to image comparison of moisture transport and mass loss
\item calculate mass loss on a sub basin spatial level across Greenland and compare to other estimates
\item pressure relationship
\end{enumerate}

The NAO index is unitless, and represents the relative magnitude of the 500mb pressure difference between Azores and Reykjav\'ik compared to the 1950--2000 monthly mean.
