\section{Introduction \label{sec:introduction}}

Average global surface temperature is rising at an increasing rate --- approximately $0.09\degree$~C per decade since 1880, and approximately $0.26\degree$~C per decade since 1979 \cite[][]{ipcc2013_atmosphere}
--- with the past five years (2014--2018) being approximately $0.84\degree$~C warmer than the 1880--2018 average \cite[][]{NOAA_stateofclimate}. Earth's warming climate has contributed to significant melting of the Greenland ice sheet, and recent ice loss is estimated at $-244$~Gt per
year \cite[][]{Harig+2015a,Harig+2016}. The Greenland Ice Sheet covers just over 1\% of
Earth's surface, and, if completely melted, would raise sea level by over $7$~m
\cite[][]{ipcc2013_cryosphere}.
Global melting of ice sheets and glaciers accounts for almost half of recently observed rising sea levels, with Greenland alone contributing almost $25$\% of the $3$~mm per year of sea level rise observed since 1993
\cite[][]{Nerem}.  Our broad goal is to understand the nature and cause of deviations from modeled rates of Greenland ice melt in order to better understand, predict, and communicate the changing conditions of the planet.

Ice loss on the Greenland Ice Sheet has been observed in
gravitational measurements from NASA's Gravity
Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), satellite and airplane based
altimetry, and energy balance models, finding acceleration of melt in the ice mass signal over most of the last two decades \cite[][]{khan2015,Harig+2016}. Rates of ice loss increase by a
combination of greater discharge from calving glacier termini at the edges of
the ice-sheet and decreased surface mass-balance, the difference between
seasonal snow accumulation and melting \cite[][]{khan2015,enderlin2014}.
Significant inter-annual variability and asynchronicity has been observed in
the discharge rates of the Greenland Ice Sheet's major drainage basins, while
surface mass-balance is comparatively more predictable
\cite[][]{mcmillan2016,enderlin2014}. Both contributions to ice loss accelerated between 2000--2012, combining for a total acceleration of ice mass
estimated at nearly $-30$~Gt per year$^2$ over all of Greenland
\cite[][]{velicogna2009,enderlin2014,bevis2019}.

Isobar height contours are labeled in $10^4$~m, and wind vectors are shown by arrows. Note the location of the northern polar jet stream, dividing the low and high isobar heights around the $1.05\times 10^{4}$~m contour. The temporary North Atlantic Rossby wave is labeled as the ``HI'' pressure anti-cyclone moving north towards southern Greenland, with a complementary ``LO'' pressure cyclone centered over Labrador. Note that the jet stream is deflected through the Labrador Sea and Baffin Bay, along the West Coast of Greenland. As a result of these conditions, the ``LO'' pressure over Reykjav\'ik is pushed north, and the pressure difference between Reykjav\'ik  and Azores is lowered, resulting in an negative NAO index (top left).} \label{fig:jetstream}

A study by \cite{Harig+2016} modeling the mass of the Greenland Ice Sheet
using GRACE data products showed deviations from the long-term accelerating
trend, starting with a high level of melt in the summer of 2012, and followed by two
summers of little melting in 2013 and 2014 \cite[see
Figure~\ref{fig:Getraer} A, comparable to][their
Figure~4]{Harig+2016}. Our analysis of the complete GRACE data set (2002--2017) using identical methods showed a linear,
not accelerating, trend of ice loss for the Greenland Ice Sheet, constraining the observed unexpected deviations to an unusually large melt summer of 2012 followed by a summer of unusually little melt in 2013 (see
Figure~\ref{fig:Getraer} B). 


The anomalous seasons of 2012--2013 have received attention in recent literature by studies attempting to understand how surface mass balance processes produce such inter-annual variability. Correlations have been found with climate indices such as the phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) \cite[][]{mcmillan2016,bevis2019,getraerFall}, transient atmospheric transport of warm air and water vapor in so-called "atmospheric rivers" \citep{mattingly2018}, and non-radiative energy flux enhanced by short-term cloud cover \citep{solomon2017}.

%% SIGNIFICANCE OF THE POLAR JET STREAM
\subsection{Atmospheric Circulation Over the Greenland Ice Sheet}
The atmospheric circulation affecting the Greenland Ice Sheet is broadly controlled by the position of the polar jet stream in the northern hemisphere \cite[][]{hanna2013,mattingly2018}. The northern polar jet stream is a strong current of air moving generally eastward, dividing the warm, high pressure air of the temperate mid-latitudes and the cold, low pressure air of the Arctic. In the North Atlantic, the average position of the polar jet results in a low pressure Arctic system centered near Iceland, and a high pressure temperate system centered near the Azores. The strength of the polar jet stream moving air zonally across the North Atlantic is determined by the relative meridional pressure difference across the North Atlantic, and varies irregularly in what is called the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).

The NAO is often indexed for use in climate analyses by differencing the atmospheric pressure over the North Atlantic and a "loading pattern" of pressure determined by principal component analysis to capture the average meridional pattern \cite[][]{hurrelNAO,cpcNAO}. A positive phase NAO index reflects a stronger meridional difference in pressure than usual, while negative values reflect a weaker meridional difference than usual \cite[][]{hurrelNAO}. The index is a unitless ratio normalized by the variance of atmospheric pressure from the loading pattern.


In studying melt events on the Greenland Ice Sheet, many studies have used an NAO index to relate melting conditions to atmospheric pressure patterns. Strong summer melt events often occur with a negative NAO index, suggesting that mechanisms which drive the NAO may have some kind of predictable implications for melting on Greenland \cite[][]{hanna2013,mattingly2018,mcmillan2016,bevis2019,getraerFall,hahn2018}. More precisely, the use of the NAO index suggests that meridional pressure differences which drive westerly winds across the North Atlantic are a physical mechanism for strengthening melt conditions over Greenland --- warm, moist air, and increased cloud cover \cite[][]{hanna2013,mattingly2018,mcmillan2016,bevis2019,getraerFall,hahn2018}. This assumption, however, obscures the fact that melt events are often caused by southerly winds advecting atmospheric rivers of warm, moist air north, which is driven by a zonal difference in pressure \cite[][]{hanna2013,mattingly2018}.

The polar jet does not maintain stable zonal flow, and regularly develops wiggles in which flow is diverted meridionally in large waves. During these events, known as a Rossby waves, temporary high-pressure systems push northward into the arctic accompanied by complementary low-pressure cyclones which develop on either side of the high-pressure block. The combined flow from these pressure systems advects warm air from the temperate mid-latitudes into the Arctic until the Rossby wave ``breaks'' and the jet stream return to its typical location.

Melt events on Greenland are generally driven by zonal differences in pressure resulting from Rossby wave systems with high pressure ``blocking'' over southern Greenland, which create atmospheric rivers advecting warm moist air over the ice sheet \cite[][]{mattingly2018}. In contrast, the NAO index measures against a meridional patterns of pressure, with the result that although melt events often correspond with a weaker NAO, a lower the NAO index does not necessarily imply a greater melt event.

High pressure blocking over southern Greenland is often correlated with a negative NAO index, because the northern excursion of high pressure systems influences meridional pressure balance. However, despite their correlation, the two are fundamentally different atmospheric patterns which drive advection of air in different directions. In some recent studies, the Greenland Blocking Index (GBI) has been used, which is essentially the average pressure over Greenland. While this is more specific and more relevant than the NAO index, it still does not directly reflect the meridional advection which drives melt.

In this paper, I explore simple indices which directly compare zonal pressure differences which flow of warm air into the arctic over the Greenland Ice Sheet, and compare those results to the NAO and GBI indices.



 
 
% These atmospheric conditions are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:jetstream}, illustrating the Greenland blocking event in July 2012, immediately preceding record surface melting on the Greenland Ice Sheet on 07/11/2012 \cite[][]{hanna2013,mattingly2018}.



%The conclusion of many studies would be to suppose that the NAO is driving Greenland melt, and to look to patterns in the NAO index to understand the future of Greenland's ice sheet. This is highly concerning, as there are strong signs that the NAO has been trending more and more negative in recent years. However, it is crucial to note that there are significant theoretical obstacles in the correlation of the NAO index to melt. 



%The general conclusions drawn by these studies point to common atmospheric processes of uncommon duration or intensity.

In my Spring 2018 JP, I explored the use of a 2-D wavelet basis to represent the GRACE gravimetric data over Greenland such that meaningfully contributing basis functions also contained information about spatial structure (see
Figure~\ref{fig:thegrid}). 

I developed a procedure for choosing the most important wavelet basis functions in order to extract the true fluctuation of the signal from the over-determined image calculated from the typical GRACE spherical harmonic basis. I then tested which wavelet basis function best captured the 2012--2013 deviation from the expected signal, finding the deviations to be concentrated in southwestern Greenland (see
Figure~\ref{fig:deviant}). 



\section{Data}

\subsection{Ice Data}

Observations of ice loss are measured remotely by weighing the mass by gravitational anomaly, photographing the surface area, and by measuring relative height of the ice with passive and active altimetry.

In addition to data sets which directly measure aspects of ice change, we have complimentary measurements which capture some of the processes which control melting, such as air temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. Atmospheric data are measured directly at weather station all over the world, and are synthesized into large continuous data sets referred to as "reanalysis" data. "Reanalysis" data sets are the outputs of climate models, which use assumptions about the laws which govern atmospheric processes to compute simulations of the atmosphere constrained by directly observed weather data.

\section{Discussion}

%% using the NAO
Often times monthly means are reported when comparing an NAO index to a melt event \cite[][]{mattingly2018}, even though daily or sub-daily solutions are readily available, and despite the fact that the physical atmospheric drivers of melting (such as temperature, cloud cover, etc.) are changing on a daily, not monthly, basis.


%% is Greenland warming?
\subsection{Greenland is melting, is it warming?}
The melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet is strongly connected to warming temperatures in much of the literature, and the significant repercussions of various short-term warming scenarios on the evolution of ice sheet melting are of great importance to predicting sea-level rise over the next century \cite[][]{hahn2018,pattyn2018,ruckamp2018}. To best understand the relationship between warming temperatures and Greenland melt, some caution must be used in drawing a direct line between increasing mean global surface temperatures and increases of melt on the Greenland ice sheet. 

Between the late 1990's and 2012, an apparent pause in the rise of mean global temperatures coincided with the strongest acceleration in Greenland ice sheet mass loss of the last century \cite[][]{kosaka2013,angelen2014,bevis2018}. The ``hiatus'' observed in global warming over the first decade of the 21st century has been correlated with natural climate variability such as the El Ni\~{n}o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), with heat being stored in cooler La Ni\~{n}a ocean waters \cite[][]{kosaka2013}. Between 2012 and 2017, mean global temperatures resumed a strong upwards trend driven by a negative to positive shift in ENSO phase (see Fig.~\ref{fig:ENSO}).

Over the same period, mean Greenland Ice Sheet near-surface temperature did not rise significantly, and in fact was decreasing slightly across almost the entire ice sheet between 2003 and 2017 \cite[see Figs.~\ref{fig:ENSO}~\&~\ref{fig:Tslope}, and ][]{hearty2018, westergaard2018,reeves2017}. Temperatures over Greenland are expected to continue to rise with global temperatures into the future, but have not done so significantly since the 1990's \cite[][]{reeves2017}

\section{Next steps}

\begin{enumerate}
\item quantitative image to image comparison of moisture transport and mass loss
\item calculate mass loss on a sub basin spatial level across Greenland and compare to other estimates
\item pressure relationship
\end{enumerate}

The NAO index is unitless, and represents the relative magnitude of the 500mb pressure difference between Azores and Reykjav\'ik compared to the 1950--2000 monthly mean.
