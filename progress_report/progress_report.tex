\section{Introduction \label{sec:introduction}}

Precipitous melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet forms a key part of the picture of climate change and global warming, especially in sensationalized news headlines in which the subtlety and complexity of scientific conclusions may be waved in favor of drama [e.g. \textit{``Greenland's Ice Melt Is in `Overdrive,' With No Sign of Slowing''} \cite[][]{climatenews}; \textit{``Greenland's ice is melting four times faster than thought''} \cite[][]{natgeo}; \textit{```The only thing we can do is adapt': Greenland ice melt reaching `tipping point,' study finds''} \cite[][]{cnn}]. While generalized connections between climate warming and increased ice melting are both broadly true, and simple to communicate, there is a more complex picture behind the increased rates and tipping points referenced in popular media. 

Physical drivers of the recent changes in ice melt have a significant amount of temporal and spatial variability, which complicate the picture one might get from merely extrapolating total losses over the past two decades into the future \cite[][]{enderlin2014,mcmillan2016,mattingly2018,hahn2018,bevis2019}. Previous work has shown that the total mass loss trend of the Greenland Ice Sheet between 2003--2017 is best modeled by a constant, not increasing, rate of ice melt \cite[][]{getraerFall}, and outside of the news headlines, the more extreme melt seasons of the past decade are increasingly being contextualized as natural variability occurring superimposed on underlying trends of global warming \cite[][]{mattingly2018,hahn2018,bevis2019}. 

In this study, I examine the relationship between mass loss and temperature on the Greenland Ice Sheet, contextualizing recent trends and variability within the 1980--2017 climate record of the MERRA-2 climate reanalysis and the 2003--2017 mass anomaly record of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) (see~\nameref{sec:data}). I find that since 1980, temperatures over the Greenland Ice Sheet have risen differently from the overall Northern Hemisphere average, and that warming on the ice sheet has seasonal differences in both magnitude and spatial distribution. Direct comparison with mass loss shows that short-term ($<10$~year) increases in melt rates, such as those observed leading up to the anomalously high melt season of 2012, are directly correlated in time and space with increasing temperature anomaly. Finally, spatial comparisons between climate variables and mass loss are examined for insight into the accuracy of GRACE measurements at spatial scales nearing fundamental spatial resolution.

An important motivator of this study is to explore the physical drivers of melting ice in order to better interpret communication about global warming and ice loss. When headlines prefer dramatic crisis over scientific accuracy, they risk losing both: the good science behind it is buried, and the door is left open to skeptics who often find legitimate flaws in the way information is being popularly disseminated [e.g. \textit{``Skeptics put the freeze on NASA `hot air' about Greenland ice''} \cite[][]{fox}, \textit{``Greenland Glacier Grows, Despite Al Gore's Claims of Melting Glaciers''} \cite[][]{mrc}]. When policy decisions must be made on a relatively short timescale compared to variability within climate signals, and have a limited record of data to draw from, the percieved legitimacy of policy and of science depends on getting the story right. In this paper, I hope to contribute to that goal.

\subsection{Previous Results}

With the launch of NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) in 2003, a single source, big picture answer was provided to the question ``How much is Greenland melting?'' As the dataset extended and analysis improved over the next decade, the GRACE satellites provided gravitational measurements of mass change over Greenland, showing clear losses every Summer season, with regression models showing an apparent $10\%$ yearly acceleration ice loss through 2012
\cite[][]{velicogna2009,angelen2014,enderlin2014,Harig+2016,bevis2019}. This prior hypothesis, that Greenland's ice is melting at increasing rates, not only describes the first decade of GRACE data well (see Figure~\ref{fig:Getraer}), but makes sense within the broader context of global warming.

\caption[Greenland Mass Trend: 2003--2017]{Total mass changes for Greenland over the complete GRACE record using equivalent methods to \cite{Harig+2016}. Shown in \textbf{A} are the $\underline{m}_1$ (linear) and $\underline{m}_2$ (quadratic) models for 01/2003--06/2013, comparable to previous estimates of the mass trend \citep{Harig+2016}. Note the significant departure of the extrapolated $\underline{m}_2$ model from the continuing signal. Shown in \textbf{B} is the $\underline{m}_1$ linear model for 01/2003--06/2017 with the standard of deviation of its residuals. Note that the $\underline{m}_1$ model does not significantly change after including the entire GRACE record. Error bars represent $2\sigma$ based on the combined variance of modeled Slepian coefficients $f_{\alpha}$ (see \cite{Harig+2016}, as well as \cite{getraerFall,getraerSpring}). This figure appeared in \cite{getraerFall,getraerSpring}, here with minor updates.} \label{fig:Getraer}
\end{figure}

Average global surface temperature is rising at an increasing rate---approximately $0.09\degree$~C per decade since 1880, and approximately $0.26\degree$~C per decade since 1979 \cite[][]{ipcc2013_atmosphere}---with the past five years (2014--2018) being approximately $0.84\degree$~C warmer than the 1880--2018 average \cite[][]{NOAA_stateofclimate}. Earth's warming climate has contributed to significant melting of Earth's cryosphere, including the Greenland Ice Sheet where recent ice loss is estimated at $-244$~Gt per
year \cite[][]{ipcc2013_cryosphere,Harig+2015a,Harig+2016}. 
Global melting of ice sheets and glaciers accounts for almost half of recently observed rising sea levels, with Greenland alone contributing almost $25$\% of the $3$~mm per year of sea level rise observed since 1993
\cite[][]{Nerem}. 



With globally increasing temperatures, it seems logical that melt on the Greenland Ice Sheet would increase each year. However, in the final $5$~years of GRACE data, the initially hypothesized acceleration did not pan out (see Figure~\ref{fig:Getraer}). A high level of melt in the Summer of 2012 was followed by two Summers of very little melting in 2013 and 2014, and the end of the GRACE record does not come close to continuing the initially hypothesized acceleration  \cite[see
Figure~\ref{fig:Getraer} A, comparable to][their
Figure~4]{Harig+2016}. This disruption of the apparent 2003--2012 trend was initially described as a ``departure'' or ``deviation'' \cite[][]{Harig+2016}, and more recently as a ``pause'' \cite[][]{bevis2019}, from the accelerating rate of ice loss. While theoretically the long term trajectory of ice loss in a warming climate would be accelerating, the higher melt years within the 2003--2012 are increasingly being contextualized as inter-annual variability with unknown correlation to broader warming and climate change \cite[][]{mattingly2018,hahn2018,bevis2019}. Previous analysis of the complete GRACE data set (2003--2017) using identical methods to \cite{Harig+2016} shows a linear, not accelerating, trend of ice loss for the Greenland Ice Sheet, constraining unexpected deviations mostly to an unusually large melt Summer in 2012 followed by a Summer of unusually little melt in 2013 (see
Figure~\ref{fig:Getraer} B), both of which were primarily concentrated in the SW of the Greenland Ice Sheet (see Figure~\ref{fig:deviant}).

Note the large residual gap between the two lines from July~2012--July~2013, after the anomalously large melt season of 2012. By returning in the actual values of only four wavelet coefficients to the modeled wavelet reconstruction we improve the variance of the residuals by $15\%$. These wavelets are shown inset, colored as a heat map by their coefficient weights in September 2012 (the extreme of the deviation) and are concentrated in southwestern Greenland. ``m$_{\zeta\gamma}$'' refers to a wavelet basis function ``m'' of index $\gamma$ in level $\zeta$.

\end{wrapfigure}

Annual change in total ice mass is generally determined by a combination of discharge from calving glacier termini at the edges of
the ice sheet and by surface mass-balance, the difference between
seasonal snow accumulation and melting \cite[][]{khan2015,enderlin2014}.
Significant inter-annual variability and inter-regional asynchronicity has been observed in the discharge rates of the Greenland Ice Sheet's major drainage basins, while
surface mass-balance has seemed comparatively more predictable
\cite[][]{mcmillan2016,enderlin2014}. The anomalous seasons of 2012--2013 have received attention in recent literature by studies attempting to understand how surface mass-balance processes produce such inter-annual variability. Correlations have been found with climate indices such as the phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) \cite[][]{mcmillan2016,bevis2019,hahn2018,getraerFall}; transient atmospheric transport of warm air and water vapor in so-called "atmospheric rivers" \citep{mattingly2018}; non-radiative energy flux enhanced by short-term cloud cover \citep{solomon2017}; as well as albedo and net downward short-wave radiation flux \citep{angelen2014}.  These theories generally relate to variability in atmospheric circulation over Greenland, demonstrating that certain conditions which enhance melt tended to occur more frequently than usual bewteen 2003--2012, and were especially strong during the 2012 melt season.

\caption[Atmospheric Circulation Around Greenland]{Example of atmospheric conditions at the $250$~hPa isobar over the North Atlantic preceding record Greenland Ice Sheet surface melt, 07/09/2012 (from MERRA-2 reanalyzed data). Isobar height contours are labeled in $10^4$~m, and wind vectors are shown by arrows. Note the location of the northern polar jet stream, dividing the low and high isobar heights around the $1.05\times 10^{4}$~m contour. The temporary North Atlantic Rossby wave is labeled as the ``HI'' pressure anti-cyclone moving north towards southern Greenland, with a complementary ``LO'' pressure cyclone centered over Labrador. Note that the jet stream is deflected through the Labrador Sea and Baffin Bay, along the West Coast of Greenland. As a result of these conditions, the ``LO'' pressure over Reykjav\'ik is pushed north, and the pressure difference between Reykjav\'ik  and Azores is lowered, resulting in an negative NAO index (top left).} \label{fig:jetstream}
\end{figure}



%% SIGNIFICANCE OF THE POLAR JET STREAM
\subsection{Atmospheric Circulation Over the Greenland Ice Sheet}
The atmospheric circulation affecting the Greenland Ice Sheet is broadly controlled by the position of the polar jet stream in the northern hemisphere \cite[][]{hanna2013,mattingly2018}. The northern polar jet stream is a strong current of air moving generally eastward, dividing the warm, high pressure air of the temperate mid-latitudes and the cold, low pressure air of the Arctic. In the North Atlantic, the average position of the polar jet results in a low pressure Arctic system centered near Iceland, and a high pressure temperate system centered near the Azores. The strength of the polar jet stream moving air zonally across the North Atlantic is determined by the relative meridional pressure difference across the North Atlantic, and varies irregularly in what is called the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) \cite[][]{hurrelNAO}.

%The NAO is often indexed for use in climate analyses by differencing the atmospheric pressure over the North Atlantic and a "loading pattern" of pressure determined by principal component analysis to capture the average meridional pattern \cite[][]{hurrelNAO,cpcNAO}. A positive phase NAO index reflects a stronger meridional difference in pressure than usual, while negative values reflect a weaker meridional difference than usual \cite[][]{hurrelNAO}. %The index is a unitless ratio normalized by the variance of atmospheric pressure from the loading pattern.

%In studying melt events on the Greenland Ice Sheet, many studies have used an NAO index to relate melting conditions to atmospheric pressure patterns. Strong Summer melt events often occur with a negative NAO index, suggesting that mechanisms which drive the NAO may have some kind of predictable implications for melting on Greenland \cite[][]{hanna2013,mattingly2018,mcmillan2016,bevis2019,getraerFall,hahn2018}. More precisely, the use of the NAO index suggests that meridional pressure differences which drive westerly winds across the North Atlantic are a physical mechanism for strengthening melt conditions over Greenland --- warm, moist air, and increased cloud cover \cite[][]{hanna2013,mattingly2018,mcmillan2016,bevis2019,getraerFall,hahn2018}. This assumption, however, obscures the fact that melt events are often caused by southerly winds advecting atmospheric rivers of warm, moist air north, which is driven by a zonal difference in pressure \cite[][]{hanna2013,mattingly2018}. Although the NAO loading pattern for some months suggest southwesterly winds, it is not designed to best capture the type of pattern associated with greater melting events.


The polar jet does not maintain stable zonal flow, and regularly develops instabilities in which flow is diverted meridionally in large waves. During these events, known as a Rossby waves, temporary high-pressure systems push northward into the arctic accompanied by complementary low-pressure cyclones which develop on either side of the high-pressure block. The combined flow from these pressure systems advects warm air from the temperate mid-latitudes into the Arctic until the Rossby wave ``breaks'' and the jet stream return to its average location.


In studying melt events on the Greenland Ice Sheet, many studies have used an NAO index to relate melting conditions to atmospheric pressure patterns. Strong Summer melt events often occur with a negative NAO index, suggesting that mechanisms which drive the NAO may have some kind of predictable implications for melting on Greenland \cite[][]{hanna2013,mattingly2018,mcmillan2016,bevis2019,getraerFall,hahn2018}. However, melt mechanisms such as atmospheric rivers advecting warm moist air over the ice sheet are related to zonal differences in pressure resulting from Rossby wave systems with high pressure ``blocking'' over southern Greenland \cite[][]{mattingly2018}. In contrast, the NAO index measures against a meridional patterns of pressure, with the result that although melt events often correspond with a weaker NAO, a lower the NAO index does not strictly imply a greater melt event (Figure~\ref{fig:naovt}).

\caption[NAO vs. Near surface air temperature: 2003--2017]{Comparison of daily NAO index values to mean daily near surface temperature anomaly over the Greenland Ice Sheet, 2003--2017 (see Section:~\ref{sec:data}~\& \nameref{app:a}). The scatter plot of values in \textbf{A} is binned and colored by concentration of values (blue is low, yellow is high), and shows a type-1 LSR linear fit in red, representing the fit which characterizes a relationship of temperature determined by the NAO index. The LSR fit is influenced by the orientation of the values concentrated towards the center of the plot. The blue line is the first principal component of the two data vectors, showing the single axis which best minimizes the variance of the scattered values. Note that both show a negative correlation (i.e. lower NAO relating to higher 2m air temperatures over the Greenland Ice Sheet), but the PCA fit better captures the overall extent of the data scatter, and shows almost a $1$:$1$ relationship. The variance of the data around these fit lines is illustrated in plots \textbf{B} and \textbf{C}, which show the timeseries of the two values over the 2012 and 2015 Summers. Note that in 2012, NAO and T2M correlated quite closely, while in 2015, there is far less of a connection and the lowest NAO values do not correspond to the highest temperatures.} \label{fig:naovt}
\end{figure}

High pressure blocking over southern Greenland is often correlated with a negative NAO index, because the northern excursion of high pressure systems influences meridional pressure balance. However, despite their correlation, the two are fundamentally different atmospheric patterns which drive advection of air in different directions. In some recent studies, the Greenland Blocking Index (GBI) has been used, which is essentially the average pressure over Greenland. While this is more specific and more relevant than the NAO index, it still does not directly reflect the meridional advection which drives melt.

The search for an easily definable index which captures atmospheric circulation patterns that drive melt fell outside of the scope of this project. Circulation patterns provide important context for the variability of weather events, but here I return to the more fundamental question of surface level melt processes. While the majority of energy that is absorbed by melting ice comes from solar radiation and processes which amplify insolation \cite[][]{mattingly2018, solomon2017,angelen2014}, near surface temperature broadly determines the regions which will be melting at any given time \cite[][]{broeke2011}. 

In this paper, I examine trends near surface temperature between 1980--2017 and correlation of near surface temperature to mass anomaly between 2003--2017 in order to provide context to previous results which have been examining the variability in mass loss and atmospheric forcings over the past two decades. While a few studies have examined direct relationships between temperature and melting, comparisons connect to melt maps generated through passive microwave observation from satellites, and are do not examine the direct relationship to mass loss data such as GRACE \cite[][]{cullather2018,valisuo2018}.



 
 
% These atmospheric conditions are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:jetstream}, illustrating the Greenland blocking event in July 2012, immediately preceding record surface melting on the Greenland Ice Sheet on 07/11/2012 \cite[][]{hanna2013,mattingly2018}.



%The conclusion of many studies would be to suppose that the NAO is driving Greenland melt, and to look to patterns in the NAO index to understand the future of Greenland's ice sheet. This is highly concerning, as there are strong signs that the NAO has been trending more and more negative in recent years. However, it is crucial to note that there are significant theoretical obstacles in the correlation of the NAO index to melt. 



%The general conclusions drawn by these studies point to common atmospheric processes of uncommon duration or intensity. 







%In my Spring 2018 JP, I explored the use of a 2-D wavelet basis to represent the GRACE gravimetric data over Greenland such that meaningfully contributing basis functions also contained information about spatial structure (see
%Figure~\ref{fig:}). 
%
%I developed a procedure for choosing the most important wavelet basis functions in order to extract the true fluctuation of the signal from the over-determined image calculated from the typical GRACE spherical harmonic basis. I then tested which wavelet basis function best captured the 2012--2013 deviation from the expected signal, finding the deviations to be concentrated in southwestern Greenland (see
%Figure~\ref{fig:deviant}).

\section{Data \label{sec:data}}

\subsection{Ice Mass Data}

Observations of ice loss across large areas are measured remotely by satellites using several different methods, including weighing the mass by gravitational anomaly (such as NASA's GRACE and GRACE Follow-On missions), photographing surface area (such as NASA's \href{https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov}{Landsat} and \href{https://terra.nasa.gov/about/terra-instruments/modis}{MODIS} missions), and by measuring relative height of the ice with active laser altimetry (such as NASA's \href{https://icesat.gsfc.nasa.gov/icesat/}{ICESat} and \href{https://icesat-2.gsfc.nasa.gov}{ICESat-2} missions) \cite[][]{khan2015}.

Data used in this study come from the GRACE satellite mission, span from 2003--2017, and were released as global spherical harmonic coefficients by NASA in the CSR-RL05 data product (see \nameref{app:a}; for an in depth review of GRACE data reduction methods, see \nameref{app:b}). For this project, the RL05 spherical harmonic coefficients were evaluated directly onto the analysis grid (see Figure~\ref{fig:gridbasins}).
 
 \subsection{Atmospheric Data}
 
 
In addition to datasets which directly measure physical manifestations of ice sheet melting, there are complimentary datasets which capture some of the processes which control melting such as air temperature, humidity, and cloud cover. The primary atmospheric data used in this study are reanalysis products from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) (see Table~\ref{tab:merradata} and \nameref{app:a}).

``Reanalysis'' refers to a way of processing an ensemble of directly measured weather observations using a consistent set of rules that assume physical constraints on the ways in which different atmospheric variables interact temporally and spatially \cite[][]{gelaro2017}. These physical constraints are defined by a global climate model, which can both make forecasts of future developments of meteorological variables and output modeled solutions based on weather measurements directly observed at weather stations all over the world \cite[][]{gelaro2017}. Variable values for a given time and spatial location are calculated as a best fit of direct observations to the constraints of multiple different models which define processes such as radiation balances, physical movement, chemical interactions, precipitation, and so forth, or are inferred by the models' rules from variables which are directly measured \cite[][]{bosilovich2016,gelaro2017}.  

The data for this study come from NASA's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office's Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) climate models, and are publicly available in specific MERRA-2 data products through the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data Information Services Center (GES DISC) (see \nameref{app:a}). MERRA-2 data are available in several different spatial and temporal formats for different variables. I use gridded daily averages for examining the connections between meteorological variables over the Greenland Ice Sheet, and gridded monthly averages for capturing the long-term development of Greenland's climate. Daily and monthly data are taken from collections of single-level, two-dimensional data which GES DISC provides in a few MERRA-2 datasets (see Table~\ref{tab:merradata}, \nameref{app:a}).
 

Daily and monthly NAO climate index values are provided by the National Weather Service Climate Prediction Center, which calculates NAO index values from the $500$~mb pressure level height over the spatial extent of $20$--$90^{\circ}$~N \cite[][]{cpcNAO}. Pressure level heights are compared to a monthly loading pattern defined as the first principal component of a rotated principal component analysis on the 1950--2000 $500$~mb height time-series and values are normalized by monthly mean and standard of deviation for the 1950--2000 index time-series \cite[see \nameref{app:a} and][]{cpcNAO}.

Lastly, Northern Hemisphere climate data are from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP v3) as a mean monthly Land-Ocean Temperature Index (LOTI), which takes into account dampening of atmospheric temperature changes due to the heat capacity of ocean water \cite[][]{hansen2010}. The data used here are a monthly index of temperature anomalies from 1951--1980 time-series, which are available from 1880--present \cite[see \nameref{app:a} and][]{hansen2010}.

 \section{Methods}
 
All analysis of MERRA-2 data over the Greenland Ice Sheet was masked using a widely used shape-file of the ice sheet developed from the drainage subregions defined by \cite{zwally2012}, reorganized into quadrants similar to \cite{mcmillan2016} (see Figure~\ref{fig:gridbasins}). Anomaly values were calculated by subtracting the mean value for that month relative to the given period being examined. Seasonal values are the mean of all values falling within the months of that season, defined as Winter (December-January-February), Spring (March-April-May), Summer (June-July-August), and Fall (September-October-November). Comparisons of mass anomaly and MERRA-2 variables were done on the analysis grid described in Figure~\ref{fig:gridbasins}, using bi-linear interpolation to sample the MERRA-2 variables. Spatially heterogeneous trends were analyzed by modeling the anomaly of each point on the analysis grid through time (e.g. Figure~\ref{fig:tslopes}).

In the image basis (\textbf{B}) the grid is cartesian with length $128$. The filled black area is the island of Greenland, with the extent of the ice sheet superimposed in white, and dotted lines delineating the regional quadrants that we consider \cite[see \textbf{C}~\&][]{zwally2012}.

Points on the grid are approximately $20$--$25$~km apart, finer than both GRACE and MERRA-2 spatial resolutions. Drainage subregions of Greenland used to define ice sheet extent and quadrants in this paper are derived from \textbf{C} \cite[figure and data from][]{zwally2012}. Quadrants shown in \textbf{B} are unions of these subregions as follows: NW~$=\cup(1.1, 1.2)$; NE~$=\cup(1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2)$; SE~$=\cup(3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3)$; SW~$=\cup(5.0,6.1,6.2,7.1,7.2)$, similar to the divisions made in \cite{mcmillan2016} \label{fig:gridbasins}}

 Over the 1980--2017 time period the Northern Hemisphere has been gradually warming, and averaging across the monthly LOTI anomaly with 10~year moving window reveals a quite linear trend of $0.24^{\circ}$C per decade (type 1 least-squares regression, with a variance reduction $\mathrm{R^2}=0.987$), for a total increase of $0.89^{\circ}$C since 1980 (see Figure~\ref{fig:climatewarming}). Over the same time period, near surface temperature anomalies over the Greenland Ice Sheet had a significantly different pattern of increase, remaining static through the 1980's and more recently since the early 2000's, and increasing dramatically through the 1990's (Figure~\ref{fig:climatewarming}). Comparing the first 15 years (1980--1994) of the 1980--2017 time period to the last 15 years (2003--2017), the mean temperature rose $1.53\pm0.42^{\circ}$C as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:climatewarming} (two sample $t$-test found distributions of significantly different mean values, $p = 2.3\mathrm{e}{-12}$; reported error represents the $95\%$ confidence interval on the difference in mean values).

Data has been filtered using 6-month and 10-year moving windows for ease of interpretation, with the shaded area representing the spread of the data using the standard of deviation of the 10-year moving window. Note the more continuously linear increase in Northern Hemisphere temperature over the entire time-period compared to the non-linear jump in temperature over Greenland in the 1990's. Analyses of the unfiltered time-series show that: the Northern Hemisphere LOTI is increasing at $0.24^{\circ}$C per decade ($\mathrm{R^2}=0.987$); near-surface air temperature increased $1.53\pm0.42^{\circ}$C between the years 1980--1994 and 2003--2017.} \label{fig:climatewarming}

Rise in near surface air temperature across the Greenland Ice Sheet between 1980--2017 differed seasonally, with the greatest rise in temperature occurring in the Winter season (December, January, February) and the smallest rise in temperature occuring in the Summer season (June, July, August) (see Figure~\ref{fig:seasonalclimate}). The fitted linear trends were tested for significance against the hypothesis that a trend of the same magnitude could be generated from similar random data (normally distributed data of the same mean, standard of deviation, and number of points). $p$-values for the trends represent the percentage of trends of greater magnitude found in $10000$ tests of similar random data (the trend slope of greatest absolute value would have $p(\mathrm{max}) = 0$, and a trend slope of $0$ would have $p(0) = 1$). A similar method was used to calculate the confidence interval of these trends, by subtracting the linear fit, generating $10000$ tests of similar random data, and finding the $90^{\mathrm{th}}$ and $95^{\mathrm{th}}$ percentile of slope magnitude amongst the random test data. 

For the seasonal near surface air temperature trends between 1980--2017, all were found to be significant at at least the $p < 0.05$ threshold compared to the $10000$ tests of similar random data (see Table~\ref{tab:seasonaltrends}). The difference in trend between Winter and Summer months is significant in the random simulations, with the best fit trend for each falling outside of the $90\%$ confidence interval of the other (see Table~\ref{tab:seasonaltrends}).

The trend is the type 1 least squares regression slope of the mean monthly data, and confidence intervals are the results of synthetic data tests analyzing the residuals of the data and the trend line. $p$-values represent the chances of finding a trend slope of equal or greater magnitude in a random sampling of a ``similar'' normal distribution. For 1980--2017, all seasons have trend magnitudes that are significantly different from a random sampling of a ``similar'' normal distribution at the $p < 0.05$ threshold; Winter and Summer seasonal trends are significantly different from each other at the $90\%$ confidence interval; Fall and Spring trends are not significantly different from Summer, and are not well differentiated from Winter. For 2003--2017, Winter and Fall trends are well within expected fits for similar random data, and while the Spring and Summer trends are more unusual, those negative trends are also not significantly differentiable from similar random data in $p$-value or confidence interval. \label{tab:seasonaltrends}}

Despite the overall rise in temperature since the 1980's, near surface air temperature across the Greenland Ice Sheet was not increasing over the GRACE record (2003--2017) (Figure~\ref{fig:seasonalclimate}). In fact, mean 2m air temperature anomaly over the ice sheet drifted cooler in every season, most markedly in Spring and Summer (see Figure~\ref{fig:seasonalclimate} \& Table~\ref{tab:seasonaltrends}). The cooling drift in temperature from 2003--2017 was analyzed for significance in the same manner as the trends over the entire 1980--2017 record (Table~\ref{tab:seasonaltrends}). The trends in Winter and Fall were indistinguishable from similar random data drawn from a normal distribution of the same mean and standard of deviation, and while the trends in Spring and Summer were more unusual for random variability, they too were poorly differentiated from similar random data in both $p$-value and confidence interval (Table~\ref{tab:seasonaltrends}). 

Taking into consideration the probability of random simultaneous negative drift in 2m air temperature anomaly across all seasons ($\prod_{\mathrm{season}=i} p_i = 0.0091$) it becomes apparent that within the larger, expected warming trend of 1980--present, Greenland experienced an unexpected cooling hiatus during the 2003--2017 GRACE record (see Figure~\ref{fig:seasonalclimate} \& Table~\ref{tab:seasonaltrends}). It is important to note that, regardless of fitted trends, the majority of the 10 warmest seasons of the 1980--2017 record have occurred during the GRACE record ($6/10$ Winters, $8/10$ Springs, $8/10$ Summers, $6/10$ Falls), and for the first decade of GRACE data, all but one Summer season on the Greenland Ice Sheet had mean temperatures above the 1980--2017 average see (Figure~\ref{fig:seasonalclimate} \& Table~\ref{tab:rankedseasons}).

In addition to differences in near surface temperature anomaly trends found in different seasons and decades, there is also significant spatial heterogeneity temperature anomaly trends across the Greenland Ice Sheet. I calculated a linear fit for temperature anomaly at each node of the grid across Greenland (see Figure~\ref{fig:gridbasins}) for years between 1980--2017, from the beginning of GRACE until the end of 2012 (2003--2012), and for the entire GRACE record (2003--2017), illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:tslopes}. The trends within those three time periods have very different features, characterized by widespread warming in all seasons (1980--2017), general cooling in non-Summer seasons with strong Summer warming in the SW region (2003--2012), and general cooling across the vast majority of the ice sheet in all seasons (2003--2017) (Figure~\ref{fig:tslopes}). 

%The patterns of temperature captured in Greenland averages which are analyzed over decades (see Figures~\ref{fig:climatewarming}~\&~\ref{fig:seasonalclimate}) are important in understanding first order changes occurring in Greenland climate, but fail to capture

Strong warming in the SW during first decade of the GRACE record was followed by a very different pattern of warming in the north and cooling in the south from 2013--2017, resulting in a trend over the entire 2003--2017 period which obscures the temperature anomaly signal in the SW (Figure~\ref{fig:tslopes}). Also of note is that Summer temperature trends differ significantly in both magnitude and spatial pattern from non-Summer trends, which dominate the fitted trends seen when seasons are not considered separately (see Figures~\ref{fig:seasonalclimate}~\&~\ref{fig:tslopes}).

The trend maps show three different time periods in separate rows, and three different seasonal combinations in separate columns.

In contrast to that 37 year trend, the first decade of GRACE saw concentrated Summer warming in the SW. This SW warming did not continue through the last 5 years of the time period, which saw a counter balancing cooling in the S and warming in the N, resulting in an apparent overall Summer cooling over the entire 2003--2017 time period. The crossplots in the righthand column show the strong correlation of non-Summer months to the trends seen when all seasons are considered, demonstrating that Summer trends are significantly different from the trends seen in other seasons, and are almost completely obscured unless Summer months are specifically isolated. Trend values are type-1 least square regressions after removing seasonal cycles.} \label{fig:tslopes}

\subsection{Comparison of Mass Loss and MERRA-2 Variables}		

As a first order analysis of atmospheric drivers of ice loss, I compared the net change in Greenland mass over the entire GRACE period to mean the average Summer (JJA) surface skin temperature (ST), 2 meter air temperature (T2M), and 2 meter specific humidity (QV2M) over the entire period (Figure~\ref{fig:comparisontotal}). Point-to-point comparisons were binned every by mass loss, showing a positive correlation between temperature and humidity and ice loss, as generally expected (Figure~\ref{fig:comparisontotal}). 

For areas with less than $750$~kg/m$^2$ of ice loss over 2003--2017, higher amounts of ice loss correlated with quadratically higher temperatures and humidity (melting more ice requires a non-linear increase in temperature, Figure~\ref{fig:comparisontotal})). In contrast, there was no difference in mean temperature between areas with $750$~kg/m$^2$ of ice loss and those with $2000$~kg/m$^2$, and it was only at losses over $2750$~kg/m$^2$ at which mean temperature and humidity had to be significantly higher (Figure~\ref{fig:comparisontotal}). 

The plateau in the relationship between mean temperature and humidity and mass loss of $750$--$2500$~kg/m$^2$ (2003--2017) is the effect of GRACE detected mass loss within that range aligning with a large variance in mean temperature (Figure~\ref{fig:comparisontotal}). The average surface temperature (ST) within that range of mass loss hovers just above $-8.15^{\circ}$C ($265^{\circ}$K), corresponding generally with the mid-range of the ice sheet, below the upper accumulation zone where mass change was positive, but shy of the periphery (Figure~\ref{fig:comparisontotal}). Over the 2003--2017 record, mean ST was consistently about $2^{\circ}$C lower than T2M, and examining the best fit regressions between the two temperatures and the GRACE data, mass loss may to be subtly more sensitive to ST---melting more ice requires a smaller change in ST than T2M (Figure~\ref{fig:comparisontotal}).

Similar comparisons were conducted for each quadrant of Greenland comparing total mass loss to T2M (Figure~\ref{fig:comparisonregions}). The eastern half of the ice sheet showed strong quadratic correlation between mass loss and temperature for areas with less than $1000$~kg/m$^2$, and the correlation in the NE never plateaus (Figure~\ref{fig:comparisonregions}). In contrast, the quadratic relationship for the western half of the ice sheet extends only to areas of less than $750$~kg/m$^2$ in the NW, and barely exists in the SW where a subregion estimated by GRACE to have near $0$~kg/m$^2$ of mass loss is located in one of the highest temperature coastal environments on the ice sheet (Figure~\ref{fig:comparisonregions}).

Cross-plotted data were binned every $250$~kg/m$^2$, with the mean and standard of deviation are represented here. Note that in zones of mass accumulation (negative mass loss on the $x$-axis) and loss of $750$~kg/m$^2$ (or mm of water equivalence, mm w.e.) average temperatures and humidity over 2003--2017 scales quadratically with increasing mass loss, while regions with $750$--$2500$~kg/m$^2$ of loss have similar ranges, and regions with $>2500$~kg/m$^2$ of loss seem to scale linearly. The quadratic and linear relationships are shown in the legend in two lines, the first giving the acceleration and intercept of the modeled variable per $1000$~kg/m$^2$ (m$^2$~w.e.) for mass loss $<750$~kg/m$^2$, and the second giving the linear rate of the modeled variable per $1000$~kg/m (m~w.e.). As the mass losses are for the entire 14 year GRACE record, these rates were normalized to reflect the amount of ice loss per year that a given change in the modeled variable relates to.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%	OVERALL TEMP
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Analysis of near surface temperature indicates that the warming of the 1990's brought average temperatures on the ice sheet to a level that remained significantly higher than previous decades, despite downward drift through the GRACE time period (see Figure~\ref{fig:climatewarming}). Leading into the first years of the GRACE record, average near surface Summer temperatures on ice sheet as a whole were $\sim0.8^{\circ}$C warmer than at the beginning of the 1980's (Figure~\ref{fig:seasonalclimate}), and through the first decade of GRACE (2003--2012), warming Summer temperature trends focused in the SW region estimate an additional increase in Summer temperatures of $0.8$--$1.8^{\circ}$C (Figure~\ref{fig:tslopes}). These estimations of a temperature anomaly of almost $3^{\circ}$C in the SW in 2012 (compared to temperatures of the early 1980's) are similar to estimates which put the Summer of 2012 at $4^{\circ}$C warmer than the 1960--1990 average \cite[][]{angelen2014}.

\subsection{Comparing GRACE ice loss to temperature}
Assuming that the physical relationship between temperature and melt is the same across the ice sheet, the underlying cause of the plateau in Figure~\ref{fig:comparisontotal} may be related to measurement, interannual variability, or mass movement. Bias and spatial resolution in GRACE continues to be pushed \cite[see][]{Harig+2012,save2016,getraerSpring}, but remains conservatively estimated at $\sim300$km $\times$ $300$km \cite[][; Greenland itself is approximately $2700$km North--South $\times$ $1200$km East--West]{scanlon2016}. 

Regions between the strong mass loss of the lower ice sheet and mass gain in the accumulation zone may be poorly resolved, and not accurately reflect local melt. This explanation is directly supported by the clear positive correlation between temperature, humidity, and mass loss seen at both the positive and negative extremes of mass anomaly, suggesting that the spherical harmonic basis of the GRACE data captures peaks of mass anomaly even when they are relatively close together (Figure~\ref{fig:comparisontotal}). Mass loss extremes on Greenland are located just over $400$km away from each other, nearing the limit of GRACE resolution, and transitions between those areas may be biased by those extremes.

Complicating the spatial limitations of GRACE are the dimensions of the ice sheet itself. The steeper eastern slopes of the ice sheet have less melt for a given temperature anomaly, simply due to the distribution of the low altitude ablation zone in those regions \cite[][]{bevis2019}. As a result, the short-distance gradient in mass anomaly captured by GRACE is not as extreme on the eastern half of the ice sheet as it is on the western half, where a larger distribution of low altitude ice in the ablation zone is exposed temperature fluctuations. If GRACE may struggle to accurately resolve regions which fall in between very close extrema of mass anomaly (distances which approach the satellites' fundamental spatial resolution), we would expect the NE quadrant to have the clearest spatial correlation with temperature, which we do in fact observe (Figure~\ref{fig:comparisonregions}).

Another factor at play in the connection between total mass lost and mean temperature over a 14 year period is inter-annual variability. Taking a mean temperature over such a timescale obscures short periods of intense melting, which may have a significant contribution to total melt.

Additionally, while temperature and humidity contribute to melting ice, the redistribution of mass after ice is melted can differ depending on local conditions, and may flow relatively directly off of the ice sheet, or get stored within the snowpack or refrozen, conditions which themselves have changed dramatically over the GRACE observation period \cite[][]{angelen2014,pena2015}.

\subsection{Concentration of melt in the SW}

The change in temperature anomaly tendency in the years just before and after 2012 aligns with similar patterns seen observed in atmospheric river tendencies, which focused more on the SW region prior to 2012, and more on the northern regions in following years \cite[][]{mattingly2018}. While it is unsurprising that warm air and moist air go hand in hand, a similar pattern in net short-wave radiation and microwave-derived melt days was also observed in the years leading up to 2012 \cite[][]{angelen2014}. The connection between air temperature, moisture, and radiation balance suggests that warm, moist air may enhance insolation driven melt not only by raising the baseline temperature of the ice surface, but by changing surface albedo and allowing greater absorption of insolation as suggested by \cite[][]{box2012}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Conclusion}
The melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet is strongly connected to warming temperatures in much of the literature, and the significant repercussions of various short-term warming scenarios on the evolution of ice sheet melting are of great importance to predicting sea-level rise over the next century \cite[][]{hahn2018,pattyn2018,ruckamp2018}. To best understand the relationship between warming temperatures and Greenland melt, some caution must be used in drawing a direct line between increasing mean global surface temperatures and increases of melt on the Greenland Ice Sheet, as temperature on the Greenland Ice Sheet has not risen in the same pattern as the broader Northern Hemisphere (see Figure~\ref{fig:climatewarming}. 

Between the late 1990's and 2012, an apparent pause in the rise of mean global temperatures coincided with the strongest acceleration in Greenland Ice Sheet mass loss of the last century, a ``hiatus'' observed in global warming over the first decade of the 21st century that has been correlated with natural climate variability such as the El Ni\~{n}o/Southern Oscillation \cite[][]{kosaka2013,angelen2014,bevis2019}. Between 2012 and 2017, mean global temperatures resumed a strong upwards trend driven by a negative to positive shift in ENSO phase.

Over the same period, mean Greenland Ice Sheet near-surface temperature did not rise significantly, and in fact was decreasing slightly on average between 2003 and 2017 \cite[see Figs.~\ref{fig:seasonalclimate}~\&~\ref{fig:tslopes}, and ][]{hearty2018, westergaard2018,reeves2017}. Mean temperatures over Greenland are expected to continue to rise with global temperatures into the future, but have not done so significantly since the 1990's \cite[][]{reeves2017}, even with the return of Northern Hemisphere warming.

In interpreting the record of Greenland Ice Sheet mass wasting, it is important to note that the linear trend observed over the entire 2003--2017 GRACE record (Figure~\ref{fig:Getraer}~B) need not be driven by changing climate over that time period. Warming mean temperatures over Greenland in the 1990's drove the ice sheet into the linear decline we have seen in the GRACE record, with an approximately constant amount of Summer loss each year \cite[][]{getraerFall}. Over that time period, anomalous years and temporary increased rates in melt are explained by variability in weather patterns across Greenland and the North Atlantic, including temporary regional warming trends \cite[see Figure~\ref{fig:tslopesSummer}][]{bevis2019,hahn2018}. It would appear that Greenland ice loss may remain in linear decline affected by natural variability until a period of sustained significant warming occurs, such as was seen in the 1990's.

%\subsection{NAO Correlation with Melt}
%Often times when comparing the NAO to Greenland melt, monthly or seasonal means are used to correlate with melt events that occur over time scales of a few days \cite[see, for example, ][]{mattingly2018, bevis2019, angelen2014}. These averaged NAO index values are used despite the fact that daily and sub-daily solutions are readily available for the NAO index, and despite the fact that the physical atmospheric drivers of melting (such as temperature, cloud cover, etc.) are changing on a daily, not monthly, basis, and are interacting directly with atmospheric pressure \cite[for example,][]{mattingly2018}.
